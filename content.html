			<h1 class="title">What Went Wrong?</h1>
			<p class="essay">
				There was once a senator who said, “One hundred fifty million sa research, P265
				million sa calamity assistance, and then P468 (million) ’yung sa machinery out of your
				budget na P1.2 billion. So ibig mong sabihin, bakit parang lahat ng inyong budget puro
				research? Baliw na baliw kayo sa research. Aanhin niyo ba ’yung research? Ako,
				matalino akong tao pero ’di ko maintindihan ’yung research ninyo, lalo na ’yung farmer.
				Gusto ba ng farmer ’yung research? ’Di ba ang gusto nila eh tulungan niyo naman sila?”

				I say let's support the senator and deduct research funds. Why should we 
				support the young minds of the Philippines? Why do we have to allocate funding for the
				research? I say;

				Let’s put more funds to intelligence or the so-called Office of the President funds.
				The total budget allotted amounting to 2.5 billion directed to sensitive activities.
				Activities that even lawmakers and critics had a hard time cracking. These allocations
				which translate to a 400% increase than the Aquino administration or even higher than
				the previous administration is just mind-blowing. Needless to say, even the billions of
				pesos that flooded the Intelligence office didn’t even stop the Marawi siege.

				Let’s put more funds into Duterte’s war on drugs. A staggering 900 million
				allotted for the PNP’s “Oplan Tokhang” anti-drug campaign. And that excluding the
				other 500 million budget that goes to the DILG’s anti-crime initiative. And yet, the
				statistics tell another story, 4,948 suspected drug users are dead, this does not include
				the other thousands for extrajudicial killings. A senator had been put to bars and a hundred 
				more critics being silenced, and not a single Drug lord was put
				behind bars. Is it a war on drugs or a war on critics?

				Let’s put more funds to dolomite sands and bring back the glory of Manila.
				Spending nearly 30 million Pesos for the beautification of a patch of land during the
				time, when even people recycle face masks.

				Yes for them Research is useless, education is inessential. They are all so
				occupied with their ego that they have forgotten that hunger can lead to violence and
				that education seeks clarity from dissolution. They could have averted the Marawi
				Siege. No amount of money can stop violence triggered by hunger and poverty. And no
				amount of brainwash can damage an educated person. Again, if the senator had spent
				more time reading the feasibility of the Mindanao case, this could be prevented.
			</p>
			
			<p class="essay">
				Spend less on research and more on ego, when all nations had already warned
				that the war on drugs will fail. Spend another billion more and a thousand more dead
				Filipino people, maybe the senator would finally realize, that the research made more
				sense than the violent driven campaign of Duterte’s war on drugs.
			</p>
			
			<p class="essay">
				And let us not forget dolomite. While the whole scientific community had already
				said to invest in mangroves, the government turned a blind eye on it. I think dolomite will
				just be a thing of the past for us since whatever the government does to hold on to the
				30 million-peso sands, nature will slowly eat up all the sands back to the sea. It’s a
				really expensive misadventure for people who don’t value research.
